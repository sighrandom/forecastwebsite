# forecastwebsite - learning python by creating a web app that allows users to submit a timeseries dataset from which a prediction will be made from an ensemble of timeseries forecasting techniques. Goal is to implement a series of standard timeseries forecasting techniques and chart out the usual model diagnostics along with a final recommended ensemble output, with key learning objectives being understanding how python works and how a simple web-application is put together with simple HTML and CSS.
# Effectively 3 parts:
# Part 1: the flask_app.py hosts the main webpage code that's written using flask and published through pythonanywhere.com
# Part 2: the processing.py hosts all the forecasting, testing and image generation functions
# Part 3: although not initially ended, simple HTML templates and CSS styling have also been used
